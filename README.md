# ResidenceRescue
ResidenceRescue is a Real-Estate Website project.This project uses the front-end languages- HTML5, CSS and Javascript along with JQuery and also the Bootstrap Framework.
This website idea sprouted from my personal experience of facing a hard time finding an accomodation when i moved cities for my University. The lack of organized data about suitable 
accomodation is something a lot of students in secluded areas face.
